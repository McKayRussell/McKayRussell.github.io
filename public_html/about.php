  <h4>We are the Se√±or Projectors</h4>  
        <br><p>As a person ages, their physiological and cognitive well-being declines. <br>
              This can be detrimental to them, not only in the physical tasks they perform <br>
              daily, but to their social lives as well. The aging process can bring about many <br>
              health concerns, such as atrophied muscles, which lower the quality of life for <br>
              these seniors. Data was gathered from a group of seniors who participated in a golf <br>
              therapy study called Golf for Healthy Aging. Our solution was to effectively show <br>
              whether or not there was a marked improvement in the individuals who underwent this <br>
              golf therapy. This was done by analyzing the given dataset using various data analysis <br>
              and clustering techniques which allowed us to confirm the effects of the study in a <br>
              computational manner. After this information was extracted and analyzed, it was <br>
              discovered that the seniors who participated in the study benefited overall from the <br>
              activity of playing golf. Furthermore, we can confidently say that golf is an adequate <br>
              form of recreational therapy for senior citizens. <br>
