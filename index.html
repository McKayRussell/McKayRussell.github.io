          <h3>Multilayer Neural Network</h3>
            <p>
                A backpropagating neural network consisting of three input neurons and three output neurons. When paired with a csv file filled with mock data, the neurons train and output their best guess as to which type of flower the data represents.

          <h3>Max One's Genetic Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                A genetic algorithm that uses tournament selection to favor rows of a 2D array with a greater amount of 1's. The goal is to, over generations, 'breed' rows with a higher concentration of 1's ultimately resulting in a row with 20 total 1's.

          <h3>Operating Systems Final Projects</h3>
            <p>
                The two final projects for my Operating Systems course. Project one is a simple parsing program that can take certain commands and execute them. It takes information from a parent process and passes it to a child process using a pipe and makes use of a signal handler.
            </p>
            <p>
                Project two is a mult-thread producer/consumer solution making use of a single producer and multiple consumer semaphores. The producer reads lines from a text file and creates a message that a specific consumer will process. This program also makes use of a CTRL-C handler.
          </p>
