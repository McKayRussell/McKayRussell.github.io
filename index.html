        <h3>Data Mining Senior Project</h3>
        <p>
            For my senior project my group and our professor Chengwei Lei collaborated with The Department of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy at USC.
            Using data mining techniques such as clustering and BetaCV analysis, we were able to provide USC with a better understanding of the data that they had gathered.
            USC is now looking into publishing a paper based on this work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professor Lei's website can be found <a href="https://www.cs.csub.edu/~clei/research/projects/GOLF/Golf_therapy.html">here.</a>
            From there, clicking on <a href="https://www.cs.csub.edu/~clei/research/projects/GOLF/interactive/home.php">"Interactive Page"</a> will take you to the website we created for the project.

          <h3>Mine Sweeper in Java</h3>
            <p>
                The final for my application development course required us to create an app that made use of resources and techniques we had been shown throughout the class.
                This was a difficult project because it required me to figure out the logic for things like clearing squares when a square with no mine near it is clicked which turned out to be more challenging than I had expected.
                It was also challenging because I wanted to make an apk version that could be played on Android phones as well as the Android emulator we used for the class. This required me to spend time fine tuning the game for more than one resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project code can be found <a href="https://github.com/McKayRussell/Programs/tree/master/App%20Dev%20Final%20Project">here</a> on Github
                along with an .apk file that can be downloaded on an Android device or emulator to play the game.

          <h3>Data Cleaning and Analysis in Python</h3>
            <p>
                In programming languages we were required to do a group project that involved using Python to clean and analyze similar data sets.
                We were allowed to use the Python data analysis library, pandas, which was very helpful.
                However, it was still challenging to anticipate and catch errors that would arise from giving the program different data sets.
                There was also an incentive to make the fastest code in the class which added a level of challenge. Our group had the second fastest code.

                The project code can be found <a href="https://github.com/McKayRussell/Programs/tree/master/Prog%20Lang%20Group%20Project">here</a> on Github.
                The data file that we used for the project is about 200MB in size.

                A genetic algorithm that uses tournament selection to favor rows of a 2D array with a greater amount of 1's. The goal is to, over generations, 'breed' rows with a higher concentration of 1's ultimately resulting in a row with 20 total 1's.
